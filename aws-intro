Imagine a datacentre with many computers or servers.

Many computers, many servers.

Hundreds or even thousands of computers running together to provide compute resource to an organization

or to its branches.

Now imagine all these computers are virtualized, hypervisors are installed on them.

So virtualization team can create virtual machines and allott it to the right individual.

So if the employees in the organization need a virtual machine or computer to do some computation,

they will contact the virtualization team to provide them the compute resource. Virtualization team.

Working with D.C. Ops team will work around the clock to create, manage and maintain these virtual

machines or virtual storage as well.

So more bigger the company, more administration will be required for the virtualized platform.

So this is a virtualization.

Before cloud computing came in.

Now, as you see similar virtualized platforms, but instead of contacting virtualization team to provide

virtual resources, you have a self-help portal, a website or even command line to access that virtualized

platform.

So if you need a virtual machine, you can just log in, create a virtual machine for yourself.

On even virtual storage, on any virtual service, for that matter.

This is called as cloud computing.

Accessing your virtualized resource over the network.

So now from anywhere you can connect to your cloud portal through APIs, create, maintain and manage

virtual resources for yourself.

Now, if this is for the organization, this is called a private cloud computing.

But if this is done for the public that anybody can sign up with the cloud provider with just their

card.

Then that is called public cloud computing.

AWS, Azure, google cloud

are some of the big names in the public cloud computing environment.

In this course, we will be using AWS cloud computing.

And let's see what AWS has to say about cloud computing.

On demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay as you go pricing.

So you don't need to procure hardware.

You can access any computing power, storage or databases from cloud provider like

AWS

So who is using cloud computing?

Well, in today's time, more than 90% of the organizations are using cloud computing.

And of course, they will use because there are a lot of benefits of using cloud computing.

Starting with agility, it's very easy and quick to get started with cloud computing.

You just need your card details.

You can sign up with AWS and start creating your compute resources.

Elasticity you can grow or shrink.

Your resources whenever you want and how much ever you need.

Cost saving.

Of course, if you can grow and shrink your resource as per your need, you also have control over the

cost.

And the big part which most of the people are missing.

You can go global in minutes.

If you have a global audience, then you can use the cloud providers global data centers.

And serve your global audience.

Types of cloud computing.

In this course, we will be using different services of AWS cloud that may fall under this bracket.

Infrastructure as a service.

So far I was talking about virtual machines.

And if you have virtual machines, you need to manage the operating system of that virtual machine, ec2

ec2 service of AWS.

is an example of infrastructure as a service.

Then you have platform as a service, where you don't need to worry about the virtualized platform also.

You just select your platform.

For example, you need an Oracle database.

You don't need to create a virtual machine.

You can use AWS RDS Service

And AWS will do everything for you to provision your Oracle database. Software as a service much,

much easier.

Just subscribe and start using them.

So we will be seeing all these three kinds of services.

From AWS

So join me in the next lecture and see for yourself of what is a cloud computing.
